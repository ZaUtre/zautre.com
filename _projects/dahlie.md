## Project Overview

Dæhlie, a brand founded by cross-country legend Bjørn Dæhlie, specializes in performance sportswear. ZaUtre partnered with Dæhlie to enhance their development lifecycle by implementing an automated software testing solution.

## The Challenge in Detail

While automated software testing is critical for large projects, it's often perceived as too resource-intensive for smaller sites. The challenge was to overcome this perception and implement a cost-effective and efficient automated testing framework for Dæhlie to ensure high-quality frontend performance.

## Our Technical Solution

### Automation Testing Framework

ZaUtre designed, built, and optimized an automation testing framework tailored to Dæhlie's needs. This framework was specifically developed to cover most of the frontend functionalities of their e-commerce site with automated tests. This ensures that new features and updates can be rolled out with greater confidence and reduced risk of regressions.

## Results & Impact

The implementation of the automated testing framework provided Dæhlie with a more reliable and efficient way to ensure the quality of their online platform. It increased test coverage for the frontend, potentially reducing bugs and improving the overall stability of the site.
