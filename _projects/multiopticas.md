## Project Overview

Multiopticas, a leading optical retail chain with hundreds of locations, partnered with Zautre to revolutionize their digital commerce capabilities. The brand sought to create an immersive online shopping experience that would complement their physical stores while addressing the unique challenges of selling eyewear online.

## The Challenge in Detail

Multiopticas faced several unique challenges in their digital transformation journey:

- **Product Visualization Complexity**: Customers needed a way to visualize how different frames would look on their faces before purchasing
- **Appointment Integration**: The platform needed to seamlessly connect online browsing with in-store eye exams and fittings
- **Complex Inventory Management**: With prescription lenses, frames, and accessories across numerous locations, inventory tracking was highly complex
- **Personalization Requirements**: Each customer has unique prescription needs, requiring sophisticated product customization
- **Omnichannel Experience**: Customers expected a cohesive experience whether shopping online, via mobile, or in-store

## Our Technical Solution

### Advanced E-commerce Platform

We designed and developed a comprehensive commerce solution tailored to Multiopticas' specific requirements:

- **Responsive Design**: Created a fully adaptive shopping experience optimized for all devices
- **High-Performance Architecture**: Implemented a modern tech stack with server-side rendering for optimal page load speeds
- **Progressive Web App Features**: Added offline capabilities and app-like experience for mobile users
- **Intuitive Product Navigation**: Developed sophisticated filtering and search functionality for their extensive catalog

### Virtual Try-On Technology

To overcome the challenge of selling eyewear online, we implemented advanced visualization features:

- **3D Model Integration**: Integrated WebGL-based 3D models of all frame styles
- **Facial Recognition**: Developed a secure system that uses the customer's camera to map facial dimensions
- **Virtual Mirror**: Created an intuitive interface allowing customers to see frames on their own face
- **Social Sharing**: Added capabilities to share virtual try-on images for feedback from friends and family

### Appointment Scheduling System

We built a sophisticated appointment system to bridge online shopping with in-store services:

- **Real-Time Availability**: Connected to store calendars to show actual appointment availability
- **Location-Based Recommendations**: Suggested the nearest stores based on customer location
- **Pre-Appointment Information Collection**: Gathered relevant information before appointments to streamline in-store visits
- **Reminder System**: Implemented automated notifications to reduce no-shows

### Inventory Management Integration

To handle complex inventory needs across multiple locations, we developed:

- **Real-Time Inventory Visibility**: Built a centralized system showing stock levels across all locations
- **Click and Collect Options**: Enabled customers to order online and pick up in their preferred store
- **Transfer Management**: Created tools for staff to manage inter-store transfers when needed
- **Predictive Stock Alerts**: Implemented algorithms to anticipate restocking needs

## Results & Impact

The implementation of the new digital commerce platform delivered significant business improvements:

- **42% Increase in Online Appointments**: The seamless appointment scheduling system dramatically increased conversion from browsers to in-store visitors
- **30% Growth in E-commerce Revenue**: Enhanced product visualization and user experience led to substantial sales growth
- **68% Increase in Mobile Engagement**: The responsive design and PWA features significantly improved mobile user metrics
- **25% Reduction in Return Rate**: Virtual try-on technology helped customers make more confident purchasing decisions
- **4.8/5 Customer Satisfaction**: Post-purchase surveys showed extremely positive feedback about the new digital experience

## Technical Architecture & Migration

### Salesforce Commerce Cloud Implementation

A critical component of our solution for Multiopticas was the strategic migration from SiteGenesis to Salesforce Commerce Cloud's Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA). This migration represented a significant technical undertaking designed to reduce complexity while enabling greater scalability.

Key aspects of our technical approach included:

- **Phased Market Rollout**: We implemented a phased deployment strategy, first launching a comprehensive MVP for the Spanish market—Multiopticas' primary market—followed by a simplified international version to support their global expansion goals.

- **Architecture Optimization**: Rather than simply replicating the existing implementation, we conducted a thorough analysis to identify opportunities for optimization, resulting in a more Commerce Cloud-centric architecture that leverages native platform capabilities.

- **Design Standardization**: Working closely with design partners, we aligned the custom user interface with SFRA best practices to maximize efficiency without compromising the brand experience.

### Advanced Integrations

The platform incorporates several sophisticated integrations that enhance the customer experience:

- **Payment Processing**: Consolidated payment solutions through Adyen, supporting multiple payment methods including regional options like Bizum in Spain.

- **Recurring Purchases**: Implemented Order Group integration to enable subscription-based services for contact lenses and other recurring eyewear needs.

- **Virtual Try-On**: Integrated Fitting Box technology that allows customers to visualize frames on their own faces through a sophisticated 3D modeling system.

- **Omnichannel Operations**: Connected physical store systems (MS) to enable in-store returns for online purchases and allow store staff to access customer prescriptions for seamless service.

- **Prescription Processing**: Developed automated workflows for prescription glasses orders, connecting with external fabricators like Cooper Vision through secure SFTP channels.

- **Marketing Automation**: Integrated with Salesforce Marketing Cloud to power personalized email communications, customer journeys, and promotional campaigns.

### Development Process

Our development approach prioritized quality and efficiency:

- **Comprehensive Requirements Analysis**: Developed a detailed Business Requirements Document with approximately 200 items covering all functional areas.

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Created reusable components for Page Designer, enabling marketing teams to configure and modify content without developer intervention.

- **Rigorous QA Process**: Established thorough regression testing protocols focused on critical functionalities like appointment scheduling, prescription management, and payment processing.

## Looking Forward

Following the successful platform launch, Zautre continues to partner with Multiopticas on further enhancements, including expanding their virtual try-on capabilities to include lens options and implementing AR features to visualize different lens treatments. We're also developing advanced analytics dashboards to provide deeper insights into customer preferences and behavior patterns.
