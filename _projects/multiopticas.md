## Project Overview

Multiopticas, a premier Spanish optical retail chain with numerous locations, partnered with Zautre to revolutionize its digital commerce capabilities. The goal was to create an immersive online shopping experience that complemented their physical stores and addressed the unique challenges of selling eyewear online. The PDF (page 8) highlights that ZaUtre collaborated with Multi√≥pticas on maintaining and supporting their existing Site Genesis site while transitioning it to the new SFRA architecture, also aiming to facilitate international market expansion.

## The Challenge in Detail

Multiopticas faced significant challenges in their digital transformation, including:

- **Product Visualization Complexity**: Enabling customers to visualize how frames would look without trying them on physically.
- **Appointment Integration**: Seamlessly connecting online Browse with in-store eye exams and fittings.
- **Complex Inventory Management**: Tracking a vast inventory of frames, prescription lenses, and accessories across many locations.
- **Personalization Requirements**: Catering to unique customer prescription needs with sophisticated customization.
- **Omnichannel Experience**: Ensuring a cohesive customer experience across online, mobile, and in-store channels.

### Virtual Try-On Technology

## Results & Impact

The new digital commerce platform yielded significant business improvements:

- **25% Reduction in Return Rate** (due to virtual try-on)
- **4.8/5 Customer Satisfaction** for the new digital experience.

## Technical Architecture & Migration

A critical aspect was the strategic migration from SiteGenesis to Salesforce Commerce Cloud's Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA) to reduce complexity and enable scalability.

### Salesforce Commerce Cloud Implementation
- **Phased Market Rollout**: MVP for the Spanish market, followed by a simplified international version.
- **Architecture Optimization**: Leveraged native Commerce Cloud capabilities.
- **Design Standardization**: Aligned custom UI with SFRA best practices.

### Advanced Integrations
- **Payment Processing**: Consolidated via Adyen, supporting multiple methods including Bizum in Spain.
- **Recurring Purchases**: Order Group integration for subscriptions (e.g., contact lenses).
- **Virtual Try-On**: Fitting Box technology for 3D frame visualization.
- **Omnichannel Operations**: Connected physical store systems (MS) for in-store returns and prescription access.
