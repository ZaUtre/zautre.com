## Project Overview

Samsoe Samsoe, a renowned international fashion brand known for their contemporary Scandinavian designs, partnered with Zautre to take over the maintenance and enhancement of their existing Salesforce Commerce Cloud platform. What began as a maintenance transition quickly evolved into a trusted long-term technology partnership.

## The Challenge

Samsoe Samsoe faced several critical challenges:

- **Maintenance Transition Risk**: They needed to switch from their previous integrator with zero disruption to business operations
- **Platform Performance Issues**: The existing implementation had speed and stability concerns, particularly during high-traffic periods
- **Product Information Management**: Inefficient PIM processes were slowing down time-to-market for new products
- **International Expansion Support**: Their growing global presence required enhanced multi-currency and multi-language capabilities

## Our Solution

### Seamless Maintenance Transition

We executed a smooth transition to become Samsoe Samsoe's dedicated SFCC maintenance partner:

- **Rapid Knowledge Acquisition**: Completed comprehensive platform knowledge transfer in just 4 weeks
- **Zero-Downtime Transition**: Maintained 100% platform availability throughout the transition period
- **Process Improvement**: Implemented enhanced development, testing, and deployment workflows
- **Documentation Development**: Created robust technical documentation in parallel with the transition

### inriver PIM Integration

After successfully taking over maintenance, we implemented a sophisticated product information management solution:

- **Centralized Product Data**: Created a single source of truth for all product information across markets
- **Automated Content Workflows**: Streamlined product enrichment and publishing processes
- **Advanced Digital Asset Management**: Enabled efficient handling of product images and media
- **Localization Support**: Facilitated easy management of multi-language product information

### Continuous Platform Enhancement

We continuously improved the existing platform with new features and optimizations:

- **Payment System Enhancement**: Refined the Adyen integration for better localized payment support
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented advanced caching and code efficiency improvements
- **Enhanced Security**: Deployed reCAPTCHA, data encryption, and PSD2-compliant checkout flows
- **OMS Data Flow Refinement**: Streamlined order management processes for operational efficiency

## Partnership Evolution

What began as a maintenance transition has evolved into a long-term partnership. Zautre now provides continuous optimization and feature development for Samsoe Samsoe, with current initiatives focused on personalization capabilities and implementing conversational commerce solutions to further enhance their customer experience.
