## Project Overview

Samsoe Samsoe, a renowned international fashion brand known for their contemporary Scandinavian designs, partnered with Zautre to transform their digital commerce experience. The brand needed a robust e-commerce solution that could support their global growth ambitions while delivering an exceptional customer experience aligned with their premium brand positioning.

## The Challenge in Detail

Samsoe Samsoe faced several challenges with their existing e-commerce infrastructure:

- **International Expansion Limitations**: Their previous platform struggled to support multi-currency, multi-language, and region-specific requirements necessary for global expansion.
- **Performance Issues**: Site speed and stability were concerns, particularly during high-traffic sales periods.
- **Limited Payment Options**: The existing payment solution didn't support the diverse payment methods preferred in different international markets.
- **Order Management Complexity**: Manual processes were required to reconcile order data across systems, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Evolving Security Requirements**: The platform needed enhanced protection against increasing bot attacks and fraudulent activities.

## Our Technical Solution

### SFCC Platform Implementation

We designed and implemented a comprehensive Salesforce Commerce Cloud solution tailored specifically for Samsoe Samsoe's requirements:

- **Custom SFRA Development**: Built on Salesforce's Reference Architecture with customizations to align with the brand's specific needs
- **Multi-site Management**: Created a streamlined approach for managing multiple international storefronts from a single admin interface
- **Responsive Design Implementation**: Ensured a consistent, premium shopping experience across all devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented caching strategies, image optimization, and code efficiency improvements for fast page loads

### Adyen Payment Integration

To support Samsoe Samsoe's international growth, we implemented a sophisticated Adyen payment solution:

- **Multi-currency Support**: Enabled seamless transactions in multiple currencies
- **Localized Payment Methods**: Integrated region-specific payment options to improve conversion in different markets
- **Tokenization**: Implemented secure card storage for returning customers, enhancing the checkout experience
- **Fraud Prevention**: Configured Adyen's risk management tools to protect the business while minimizing false declines

### OMS Data Flow Enhancement

We improved the Order Management System data flows to increase efficiency and visibility:

- **Real-time Synchronization**: Developed custom APIs to ensure order data flowed seamlessly between systems
- **Automated Reconciliation**: Eliminated manual processes through automated data matching and validation
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Created comprehensive dashboards for better visibility into order status and fulfillment metrics
- **Exception Handling**: Implemented robust processes to identify and resolve data discrepancies automatically

### Security Implementation

To protect customer data and prevent fraud, we implemented several security measures:

- **Google reCAPTCHA Integration**: Deployed advanced bot protection while maintaining a seamless user experience
- **Data Encryption**: Implemented end-to-end encryption for sensitive customer information
- **Secure Checkout Flow**: Designed a checkout process compliant with PSD2 requirements including Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)
- **Regular Security Audits**: Established a protocol for ongoing security assessment and updates

## Results & Impact

The implementation of the new SFCC platform had significant positive impacts on Samsoe Samsoe's business:

- **35% Increase in Conversion Rate**: The improved user experience and localized payment options drove substantial conversion improvements
- **28% Growth in Average Order Value**: Enhanced product discovery and streamlined checkout helped increase basket sizes
- **Successful Market Expansion**: The platform supported successful launches in five new international markets
- **60% Reduction in Order Processing Time**: Improved OMS data flows dramatically increased operational efficiency
