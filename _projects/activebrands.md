ZaUtre collaborated with Active Brands on a range of strategic initiatives to enhance their digital commerce operations across their brand portfolio.

- **Accessibility:** Ensuring US sites met AA ADA compliance standards.
- **User Experience:** Implementing various features to improve the customer journey, such as stock notifications, email verification, Google autocomplete, and ratings/reviews.
- **Transition:** Seamless transition between legacy service integrator and ZaUtre was achieved within a month
- **Platform Evolution:** Managing a significant transition by offboarding from Salesforce to a new e-commerce platform.
