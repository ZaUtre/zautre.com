## Project Overview

Sweet Protection, based in Norway, is known for creating high-quality helmets and apparel for skiers, riders, cyclists, and paddlers. ZaUtre partnered with them to enhance their e-commerce platform's content management capabilities.

## The Challenge in Detail

The primary challenge was to provide Sweet Protection's content team with modern content management tools, specifically the visual editing capabilities of Page Designer, even within their existing legacy Salesforce architecture. This would allow for more dynamic and timely updates to their storefront.

## Our Technical Solution

### Page Designer Customization

We customized and unlocked the potential of Salesforce Page Designer on Sweet's current legacy architecture. This involved adapting the tool to work effectively within their existing setup. Now, the Sweet Protection content team can use Page Designer's visual editor directly in the Business Manager. They can design, schedule, and publish custom pages by simply dragging and dropping page and component types.

## Results & Impact

This implementation empowered the Sweet Protection content team, allowing for greater autonomy and efficiency in managing their online storefront's appearance and content. It streamlined the process of creating and updating pages, leading to a more engaging and up-to-date customer experience.
