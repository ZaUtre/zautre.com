## Project Overview

Samsøe Samsøe, a brand defined by its Scandinavian heritage and wearable aesthetic, combines Copenhagen street style with a quintessential Scandinavian spirit. ZaUtre assisted Samsøe Samsøe in upgrading their e-commerce capabilities through several key integrations and enhancements.

## The Challenge in Detail

The project focused on three main areas: integrating a robust payment solution (Adyen) with their Salesforce Order Management System, enhancing their existing loyalty program (based on Voyado), and leveraging social proof by integrating user-generated content into their Salesforce Commerce Cloud site using Pixlee.

## Our Technical Solution

ZaUtre delivered a multi-faceted solution:

- **Adyen Payment Integration:** We integrated the Adyen payment platform with Salesforce OMS, ensuring seamless and secure transaction processing.
- **Loyalty Program Enhancements:** We worked on improving their existing loyalty program, which is based on Voyado, to potentially increase customer retention and engagement.
- **Social User Generated Content:** We integrated Pixlee with SFCC, enabling Samsøe Samsøe to curate and display social user-generated content on their e-commerce site, adding authenticity and social proof.

## Results & Impact

These integrations and enhancements helped Samsøe Samsøe to streamline their payment operations, provide a more rewarding loyalty experience, and enrich their site content with engaging user-generated visuals, ultimately aiming to improve the customer journey and drive sales.
