## Project Overview

Shiseido Corporation is a global leader in the cosmetics industry. ZaUtre, in collaboration with partners like Merkle, has provided long-term, high-level architectural support and strategic design services to help shape Shiseido's global e-commerce landscape.

## The Challenge in Detail

The engagement with Shiseido involved two main components:
1.  **Ongoing Architectural Support:** Providing consistent architectural guidance and support for the core codebase that underpins Shiseido's numerous global e-commerce sites, ensuring stability and scalability.
2.  **Future Architecture Design:** Addressing the need to move beyond a monolithic architecture towards a more agile and scalable solution. This required designing a composable storefront strategy that would support Shiseido's long-term global business vision for 2030.

## Our Technical Solution

### Architectural Support & Composable Storefront Design

- **Core Codebase Support:** For over four years, ZaUtre's architects, alongside Merkle, delivered continuous architectural support for Shiseido Corp.'s foundational e-commerce codebase, which serves as the backbone for their worldwide digital operations.
- **Composable Storefront Vision:** Our architects took the lead in designing a composable storefront solution. This modern architectural approach aims to replace the existing bulk architecture, providing Shiseido with the flexibility, scalability, and agility needed to achieve their ambitious 2030 business objectives on a global scale.

## Results & Impact

This long-term partnership has provided Shiseido with critical architectural stability for their current global operations. Furthermore, the strategic design of a composable storefront solution offers a clear path for Shiseido to innovate and adapt their digital experiences more rapidly, aligning their technology with their future business ambitions.
